    "text": "1.3 Background\nAs diabetes prevalence increases globally, there is an increasing need to have up to date insights into the key numbers that define the direction of our public health policies and setup of clinical attention.\nDemographic analyses based on routinely registered data with population-wide coverage have provided an excellent way of obtaining these important insights. However, even amongst countries with well-developed register systems there are differences that make it difficult to generate direct comparisons.\nFurthermore, as new specific areas of attention develop and new data sources become available, coordination and joint development of methods and expertise is necessary. This 1-day symposium aims to explore some of these themes by presenting the experiences of some of the global experts in the field. The expectation is that the discussions that emerge from the symposium will serve to define a roadmap for standardization, development of methods, education and joint research in the field.",

    "text": "2.1.1 Prof.¬†Dianna Magliano, PhD, OAM\nProfessor Dianna Magliano has a BAppSci (Hons), PhD, and a Master of Public Health. Professor Magliano has worked for over 20 years in epidemiology, the majority in diabetes, cardiovascular disease and obesity research. Her more recent work involves exploring the trends in diabetes incidence, diabetes complications and mortality across the globe and she heads a consortium of 24 collaborators to do this work. She is the current co-chair of the IDF Diabetes Atlas and is an Associate Editor for Diabetologia and a visiting professor at Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen on the project - Harnessing Multiple Large Datasets to Answer Questions on Diabetes Epidemiology ‚Äì International Centre for Population-Based Diabetes Research (IPoD) funded by the DDEA (Danish Diabetes and Endocrine Academy).\n\n\n2.1.2 Mr.¬†Bendix Carstensen, MSc.\nBendix Carstensen has been a senior statistician at Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen since 1999. He holds a degree in mathematical statistics from the University of Copenhagen. He has mostly worked with demographic aspects of diabetes, including maintaining a Danish diabetes register. He is the maintainer of the Epi package for R and the author of ‚ÄúEpidemiology with R‚Äù (OUP, 2021). He has extensive experience with international collaborations on monitoring and modelling of diabetes epidemiology and demography. Current H-index: 59\n\n\n2.1.3 Dr.¬†Edward W Gregg, PhD\nEdward Gregg holds dual appointments at Imperial College London, UK (School of Public Health), and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. He previously led a multi-disciplinary public health science unit in the Division of Diabetes Translation at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention where he championed the role of epidemiology for public health decision-making through diverse disciplines, including population surveillance, effectiveness trials, natural experiments, and health impact modelling. He has particular interests in the factors driving recent trends in the diabetes epidemic and the impact of lifestyle interventions and related health policies on diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and ageing-related outcomes.\n\n\n2.1.4 Prof.¬†Henrik St√∏vring, PhD\nHenrik St√∏vring has investigated the diabetes epidemic in Denmark during the 1990s using pharmacoepidemiologic data and showed how projections of future prevalence must incorporate developments in both incidence and mortality. He has developed new statistical methods for analyses with pharmacoepidemiologic data and has been leading research on the effects of screening for cancer and developments in diabetes mortality. Current H-index: 34.\n\n\n2.1.5 Prof.¬†Sarah Wild, PhD\nSarah Wild is professor of Epidemiology at the Centre for Population Health Sciences, University of Edinburgh. Her main interests are the epidemiology and prevention of diabetes and other non-communicable diseases, particularly among women and different socio-economic and ethnic groups, and the use of routine data for research. Sarah Wild did her medical training in London and Cambridge. Her postgraduate experience included general medicine and diabetes, general practice and public health medicine, a cardiovascular epidemiology fellowship at Stanford University and a PhD at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. She is one of the leading forced behind the SCI Diabetes register that covers all diabetes patients in Scotland.",
