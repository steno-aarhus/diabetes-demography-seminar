## Background

As diabetes prevalence increases globally, there is an increasing need
to have up to date insights into the key numbers that define the
direction of our public health policies and setup of clinical attention.

Demographic analyses based on routinely registered data with
population-wide coverage have provided an excellent way of obtaining
these important insights. However, even among countries with
well-developed register systems there are differences that make it
difficult to generate direct comparisons.

Furthermore, as new specific areas of attention develop and new data
sources become available, coordination and joint development of methods
and expertise is necessary. This 1-day symposium and meeting aims to
explore some of these themes by presenting the experiences of some of
the global experts in the field. The expectation is that the discussions
that emerge from the symposium and meeting will serve to define a
roadmap for standardization, development of methods, education and joint
research in the field.

### The target audience

Researchers (including PhD students and postdoctoral researchers)
working with register-based and epidemiological studies of diabetes, its
causes and consequences at the population level.
