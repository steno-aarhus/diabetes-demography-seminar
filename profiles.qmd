# Speaker Profiles

## Prof. Dianna Magliano, PhD, OAM

Professor Dianna Magliano has a BAppSci (Hons), PhD, and a Master of
Public Health. Professor Magliano has worked for over 20 years in
epidemiology, the majority in diabetes, cardiovascular disease and
obesity research. Her more recent work involves exploring the trends in
diabetes incidence, diabetes complications and mortality across the
globe and she heads a consortium of 24 collaborators to do this work.
She is the current co-chair of the IDF Diabetes Atlas and is an
Associate Editor for Diabetologia and a visiting professor at Steno
Diabetes Center Copenhagen on the project - Harnessing Multiple Large
Datasets to Answer Questions on Diabetes Epidemiology – International
Centre for Population-Based Diabetes Research (IPoD) funded by the DDEA
(Danish Diabetes and Endocrine Academy).

## Mr. Bendix Carstensen, MSc.

Bendix Carstensen has been a senior statistician at Steno Diabetes
Center Copenhagen since 1999. He holds a degree in mathematical
statistics from the University of Copenhagen. He has mostly worked with
demographic aspects of diabetes, including maintaining a Danish diabetes
register. He is the maintainer of the Epi package for R and the author
of "Epidemiology with R" (OUP, 2021). He has extensive experience with
international collaborations on monitoring and modelling of diabetes
epidemiology and demography. Current H-index: 59

## Dr. Edward W Gregg, PhD

Edward Gregg holds dual appointments at Imperial College London, UK
(School of Public Health), and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.
He previously led a multi-disciplinary public health science unit in the
Division of Diabetes Translation at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention where he championed the role of epidemiology for public
health decision-making through diverse disciplines, including population
surveillance, effectiveness trials, natural experiments, and health
impact modelling. He has particular interests in the factors driving
recent trends in the diabetes epidemic and the impact of lifestyle
interventions and related health policies on diabetes, cardiovascular
disease, and ageing-related outcomes.

## Prof. Henrik Støvring, PhD

Henrik Støvring has investigated the diabetes epidemic in Denmark during
the 1990s using pharmacoepidemiologic data and showed how projections of
future prevalence must incorporate developments in both incidence and
mortality. He has developed new statistical methods for analyses with
pharmacoepidemiologic data and has been leading research on the effects
of screening for cancer and developments in diabetes mortality. Current
H-index: 34.

### Prof. Sarah Wild, PhD

Sarah Wild is professor of Epidemiology at the Centre for Population
Health Sciences, University of Edinburgh. Her main interests are the
epidemiology and prevention of diabetes and other non-communicable
diseases, particularly among women and different socio-economic and
ethnic groups, and the use of routine data for research. Sarah Wild did
her medical training in London and Cambridge. Her postgraduate
experience included general medicine and diabetes, general practice and
public health medicine, a cardiovascular epidemiology fellowship at
Stanford University and a PhD at the London School of Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine. She is one of the leading forced behind the SCI
Diabetes register that covers all diabetes patients in Scotland.
